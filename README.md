# JS Demos

This repository contains various JavaScript examples created during my learning journey at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University, in the Web Technology course.

## Overview

The examples in this repository cover the basics of JavaScript including functions, events, DOM manipulation, and more. These demos aim to illustrate how JavaScript interacts with HTML to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

## Usage

The JavaScript code is written directly inside `<script>` tags within the HTML files. You can open these HTML files in any browser to see the code in action. Each demo focuses on a specific concept or feature of JavaScript, making it easier to understand and implement JavaScript in your own projects.

Feel free to explore the examples to learn how JavaScript works and how it can enhance the functionality of your web pages.
